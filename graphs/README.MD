#Graphs

<p>
    Both undirected.py and directed.py are adapted from a homework assignment I am permitted to share. As practice I has been reworking the problems to use here in my portfolio.

    <ul>
        <li>undirected.py</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Makes an undirected graph using a adjacency list</li>
            <li>Undirected class object can be initiated with or without an array of edges</li>
            <li>When edges are added to a vertex not yet in the graph, a new vertex will automatically be created</li>
            <li>Class has method to verify a given path is valid</li>
            <li>Class has methods for finding depth first search and breadth first search</li>
        </ul>
        <li>directed.py</li>
            <li>Makes a directed graph using matrix notation</li>
            <li>
            <li>Vertices are comprised of row indices of matrix</li>
            
    </ul>

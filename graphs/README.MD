# Graphs

Both undirected.py and directed.py are adapted from a homework assignment I am permitted to share. As practice I have been reworking the problems to use here in my portfolio. 
- undirected.py
    - Makes an undirected graph using a adjacency list.
    - Simple unweighted graph.
- directed.py
    - Makes a directed graph using matrix notation.
    - Graph with unidirectional weighted edges.

# Undirected Graph

The Undirected class initiates an adjacency list that represents an unweighted graph. Vertices in the graph are one character strings. Undirected can be initialized with or without edges. To initialize with edges pass a list of strings that contain both vertices i.e. ['AB', 'CD', ...]. The Undirected class also contains methods to alter the graph and get information from the graph. A list of those methods are shown below.

## Methods
- add_vertex
- add_edge
- remove_vertex
- remove_edge
- get_vetices
- get_edges
- is_valid_path
- dfs
- bfs
